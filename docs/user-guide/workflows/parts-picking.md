# Parts Picking Workflow

## Prerequisites

- Access to Supply List > Picking page
- Active work package with parts requirements
- Inventory verification complete for relevant cases

## Steps

1. **Select Work Package**: Navigate to Supply List > Picking and select the target work package

2. **Review Pick List**: Examine the parts list showing items, quantities, and storage locations

3. **Locate Parts**: Use the location info to find each item in the warehouse

4. **Scan or Confirm**: Scan each item barcode or manually confirm pickup

5. **Stage Items**: Move picked items to the designated staging area for the work package

6. **Complete Picking**: Mark the pick list as complete when all items are gathered

## Result

## Common Issues

- **Part not in location** - Check alternate locations, report if truly missing
- **Insufficient quantity** - Partial pick allowed, system tracks remaining need
- **Substitution needed** - Contact engineering for approved substitutes before picking
