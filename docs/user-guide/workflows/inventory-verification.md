# Inventory Verification Workflow

## Prerequisites

- Access to Supply List > Inventory page
- Case must be in "Moved-In" status
- Physical access to case contents

## Steps

1. **Select Case to Verify**: Navigate to Supply List > Inventory and select an unverified case

2. **Open Case**: Physically open the case and prepare to count contents

3. **Count Items**: For each line item, verify the quantity matches the expected count

4. **Record Counts**: Enter actual counts in the verification form. Highlight any discrepancies

5. **Note Damages**: Use the damage report field for any damaged items with photo upload

6. **Submit Verification**: Tap "Complete Verification" to save the results

## Result

Case status updates to "Verified" or "Discrepancy" based on results. Inventory reports reflect actual counts.

## Common Issues

- **Count mismatch** - Double-check count, then report discrepancy with details
- **Missing items** - Document missing items and notify site manager immediately
- **Damaged goods** - Take photos before moving, report in the damage field
