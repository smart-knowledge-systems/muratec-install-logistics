# EVM Reporting Workflow

## Prerequisites

- Access to Dashboard pages
- Project with baselined schedule and budget
- Progress data entered for work packages

## Steps

1. **Open EVM Dashboard**: Navigate to Dashboard > EVM Overview

2. **Select Project**: Choose project from the selector or view portfolio summary

3. **Review Metrics**: Examine SPI (Schedule Performance Index) and CPI (Cost Performance Index)

4. **Analyze Variances**: Click on metrics to drill down into specific work packages

5. **Review Forecasts**: Check EAC (Estimate at Completion) and ETC (Estimate to Complete)

6. **Generate Report**: Navigate to Dashboard > Reports to export formatted EVM report

## Result

EVM report generated with current metrics, trends, and forecasts for stakeholder distribution.

## Common Issues

- **Metrics not calculating** - Verify baseline is set and progress data is entered
- **SPI below threshold** - Drill down to identify lagging work packages
- **Unexpected variance** - Check for data entry errors before investigating root cause
