# Project Scheduling Workflow

## Prerequisites

- Access to Projects pages
- Project created with work packages defined
- PWBS structure established

## Steps

1. **Open Project**: Navigate to Projects > All Projects and select the target project

2. **Review Work Packages**: Examine existing work packages and their current schedule

3. **Set Dependencies**: Define predecessor relationships between work packages in the Dependencies view

4. **Assign Dates**: Set planned start and end dates for each work package

5. **Check Material Readiness**: Verify required materials are scheduled to arrive before work starts

6. **Publish Schedule**: Save and publish the schedule for team visibility

## Result

Project timeline displays in Gantt view. Dependencies automatically adjust downstream dates when changes occur.

## Common Issues

- **Circular dependency** - Review dependency chain, remove conflicting relationship
- **Material not available** - Coordinate with logistics or adjust schedule dates
- **Resource conflict** - Check multi-project view for overlapping resource demands
