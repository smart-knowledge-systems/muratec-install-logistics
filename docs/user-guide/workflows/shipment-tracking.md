# Shipment Tracking Workflow

## Prerequisites

- Access to Logistics pages
- Shipment created in the system
- Tracking numbers from freight forwarder

## Steps

1. **Open Shipment Board**: Navigate to Logistics > Shipment Board

2. **Locate Shipment**: Find shipment card in the appropriate column (Factory, In Transit, Customs, Delivered)

3. **Update Milestone**: Drag card to new column or click to open details and update dates

4. **Add Tracking Info**: Enter carrier tracking numbers, ETAs, or customs references

5. **Set Alerts**: Configure notifications for milestone changes or delays

6. **View Calendar**: Check Logistics > Arrival Calendar for delivery timeline impact

## Result

Shipment status reflects current milestone. Stakeholders receive notifications of changes.

## Common Issues

- **Customs delay** - Update ETA and notify site manager of revised delivery date
- **Partial shipment** - Split shipment in system, track each portion separately
- **Tracking number invalid** - Verify with carrier, update when correct number available
