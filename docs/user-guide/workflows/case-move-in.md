# Case Move-In Workflow

## Prerequisites

- Mobile device with camera access
- Access to the Supply List > Move-In page
- Physical cases at the receiving location

## Steps

1. **Open Move-In Scanner**: Navigate to Supply List > Move-In on your mobile device

2. **Scan Case Barcode**: Point camera at the case barcode. The system automatically detects and reads the code

3. **Verify Case Info**: Confirm the displayed case number and contents match the physical case

4. **Update Location**: Select the storage location from the dropdown or scan a location barcode

5. **Mark as Moved-In**: Tap the "Confirm Move-In" button to record the arrival

6. **Continue or Complete**: Scan the next case or tap "Done" to return to the dashboard

## Result

The case status updates to "Moved-In" with timestamp and location. The Field Dashboard reflects the updated move-in count.

## Common Issues

- **Barcode won't scan** - Clean the barcode, ensure adequate lighting, or enter the case number manually
- **Case not found** - Verify the case is expected for this project. Contact logistics if missing from manifest
- **Wrong location** - Use the edit function to correct location after move-in
