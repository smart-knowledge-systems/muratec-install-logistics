Iteration 6: 2026-01-18 23:55:32
Working on: US-005: Build supply table component for desktop
Status: Complete - Created sortable table with expandable rows. Key learning: Server-side sorting via Convex query parameters provides better performance than client-side sorting for large datasets. Used Badge components for case/pallet identifiers to improve visual hierarchy. Table responds properly at lg: breakpoint. See docs/dev-log/US-005.md for full details.

Working on: US-008: Build filter sheet for mobile
Status: Complete - Implemented mobile filter sheet using shadcn/ui Sheet component with bottom drawer pattern. Key learning: Using local filter state with explicit Apply button provides better UX on mobile by batching filter changes and preventing accidental URL updates. Active filter count badge improves discoverability. Sheet reuses same filter logic as desktop sidebar for consistency. See docs/dev-log/US-008.md for full details.

Iteration 12: 2026-01-19 00:32:20
Working on: US-011: Add logistics schema tables
Status: Complete - Added logistics tracking schema with shipments, caseShipments, and notifications tables. Key learning: Used v.id("tablename") for foreign key references following Convex patterns. Cached summaries (caseCount, totalWeightKg, projectNumbers) on shipments table reduce query complexity. Status unions with literals provide type safety for milestone tracking. See docs/dev-log/US-011.md for full details.
