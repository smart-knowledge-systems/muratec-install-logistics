Iteration 6: 2026-01-18 23:55:32
Working on: US-005: Build supply table component for desktop
Status: Complete - Created sortable table with expandable rows. Key learning: Server-side sorting via Convex query parameters provides better performance than client-side sorting for large datasets. Used Badge components for case/pallet identifiers to improve visual hierarchy. Table responds properly at lg: breakpoint. See docs/dev-log/US-005.md for full details.

Iteration 9: 2026-01-19 00:12:19
Working on: US-008: Build filter sheet for mobile
Status: Complete - Implemented mobile filter sheet using shadcn/ui Sheet component with bottom drawer pattern. Key learning: Using local filter state with explicit Apply button provides better UX on mobile by batching filter changes and preventing accidental URL updates. Active filter count badge improves discoverability. Sheet reuses same filter logic as desktop sidebar for consistency. See docs/dev-log/US-008.md for full details.

Iteration 12: 2026-01-19 00:32:20
Working on: US-011: Add logistics schema tables
Status: Complete - Added logistics tracking schema with shipments, caseShipments, and notifications tables. Key learning: Used v.id("tablename") for foreign key references following Convex patterns. Cached summaries (caseCount, totalWeightKg, projectNumbers) on shipments table reduce query complexity. Status unions with literals provide type safety for milestone tracking. See docs/dev-log/US-011.md for full details.

Iteration 17: 2026-01-19 00:51:41
Working on: US-015: Build shipment Kanban board
Status: Complete - Built Kanban board at /logistics with five status columns (At Factory, In Transit, At Port, Customs, Delivered). Cards display vessel, ETA, case count, project badges. Delayed shipments (>3 day ETA change) highlighted with red border/background. Key learning: Used responsive grid layout (1/3/5 columns) for optimal viewing across devices. Formatting utilities added to src/lib/utils.ts for consistent date display. See docs/dev-log/US-015.md for full details.

Iteration 30: 2026-01-19 02:06:41
Working on: US-028: Build site manager field dashboard
Status: Complete - Built comprehensive field operations dashboard at /supply-list/field-dashboard with summary cards (move-in, inventory, picking), pending actions panel, and detailed discrepancy report. Key learning: Date range filtering required lazy state initialization to avoid React Compiler purity violations. Dashboard aggregates data across three field operation tables (caseTracking, inventoryItems, pickingTasks) for real-time project visibility. Type assertions needed for status fields with broader database types than component props. See docs/dev-log/US-028.md for full details.

---
Iteration 4: 2026-01-19 05:29:44
Working on: US-031: Add project scheduling schema tables
Status: Complete - Added three schema tables for project scheduling: pwbsDependencies (PWBS category dependencies with finish_to_start/start_to_start/parallel types), workPackageSchedule (work package scheduling with dates, status, readiness, cached summaries), and projects (project master data with timeline and summary stats). Key learning: Using isDefault flag on dependencies allows template dependencies with per-project overrides. Cached aggregation fields (itemCount, totalWeightKg, pwbsCategories) on workPackageSchedule prevent repeated expensive joins. Readiness status integration prepares for material availability tracking from field operations. See docs/dev-log/US-031.md for full details.

Iteration 6: 2026-01-19 05:36:40
Working on: US-033: Create PWBS dependency management functions
Status: Complete - Created comprehensive PWBS dependency management functions supporting default (template) dependencies and project-specific overrides. Key learning: Query merge strategy efficiently combines defaults with overrides by filtering out overridden defaults using a Map lookup. Functions provide granular control (setDefaultDependency, setProjectDependency, removeDefaultDependency, removeProjectDependency) plus multiple query patterns (getDependencies, getDependenciesForPwbs, getDefaultDependencies, getProjectOverrides) for different UI needs. Three dependency types (finish_to_start, start_to_start, none) enable flexible installation sequencing. See docs/dev-log/US-033.md for full details.

Iteration 8: 2026-01-19 05:46:56
Working on: US-035: Create material readiness calculation
Status: Complete - Implemented material readiness calculation functions that check inventory status, picking status, and logistics data to determine if work packages are ready/partial/blocked. Key learning: Shared internal helper function pattern avoids circular mutation calls when implementing both single and batch operations. Used 20% critical threshold to distinguish "partial" (minor gaps) from "blocked" (significant issues). Integration with three data sources (inventoryItems for verification status, pickingTasks for pick progress, caseShipments/shipments for in-transit tracking) provides comprehensive readiness assessment. ETA info returned for blocked cases enables proactive schedule adjustments. See docs/dev-log/US-035.md for full details.
