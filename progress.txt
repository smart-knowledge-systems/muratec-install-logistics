Working on: US-005: Build supply table component for desktop
Status: Complete - Created sortable table with expandable rows. Key learning: Server-side sorting via Convex query parameters provides better performance than client-side sorting for large datasets. Used Badge components for case/pallet identifiers to improve visual hierarchy. Table responds properly at lg: breakpoint. See docs/dev-log/US-005.md for full details.
